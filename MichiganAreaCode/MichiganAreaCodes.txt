Write a program to do the following:

User provides a 10-digit phone number (using a dialog box).
The program responds to the user (in the Output window):
- the phone number printed in a "normal phone format:
    like (269) 387-1234
- whether or not it's a Michigan number (based on areaCode)
- if it IS a Michigan number, then what area it's in

       which is the part before the :
