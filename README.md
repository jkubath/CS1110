# CS1110
CS1110 - Java 1

Just starting the experience

I will be adding the code I write during my experience of learning how to program.

I am currently in my Junior year of college. I have transferred into Western Michigan University 
after taking my General Electives from Lake Michigan College.

CS1110 is the first formal class of programming for me. I am already having a great time with it.
